# a Rubik's Cube Simulation built entirely with Java and Swing
### 2d Cube Simulation:
- a net of 5 faces are shown at once 
### Moveset
- <x, y, z> cube rotations with the arrow keys
- R, R' = I, K
- L', L = E, D
- F, F' = J, F
- B', B = L, S
- U, U' = U, R
- D', D = N, V

# Layer By Layer Solver: 
7/26/20: ability to solve the cross in 10-12 moves on average so far
